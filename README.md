# Mobile App Landing Page

Welcome to the Mobile App Landing Page project. This landing page is designed to provide an informative and engaging introduction to the any mobile app. The page is crafted using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Owl Carousel, and AOS (Animate On Scroll).

## Overview
As part of my collaboration with the startup group AmazeBasket during the challenging times of the COVID pandemic, I developed a dynamic and informative landing page for their mobile app. Specializing in the delivery of fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy items, groceries, and daily essentials, AmazeBasket is committed to providing a convenient and reliable service. Users can easily adapt this common landing page to showcase information about any application. It features a responsive design, dynamic content, and visual appeal through the use of various technologies.
